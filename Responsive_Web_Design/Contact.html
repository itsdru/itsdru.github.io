            <h1>Taylor Lautner (she got married)</h1>
            <p>Taylor Lautner (Dome) was introduced to Taylor Lautner (the original one) in 2018 through his sister Makena Moore. As Taylor Lautner (the original) explained on the <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i>, Moore introduced Dome to Lautner through a game night for friends. Moore had claimed to have found him his future wife but Lautner did not give much thought as this wasn't the first "future wife" Moore had found for him.</p>

            <h3>Who is Taylor?</h3>
            <p>Taylor <i>Dome</i> Lautner became a registered nurse in 2019, a year after she met Taylor Lautner. She also uses her 1.2 million follower platform to advocate for mental health through her brand, Lemons by Tay. But before then (I'm talking wayyy before then), she was an avid Swiftie and fan of Twilight, which Taylor Lautner starred in. As of July 2023, the three Taylors collided during the production of Taylor Swift's music video for <i>I Can See You</i> where Taylor Lautner and Swift starred in the video.</p>
