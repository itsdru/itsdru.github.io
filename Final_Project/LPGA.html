            <h1>What is the LPGA?</h1>
            <p>he Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) is one of the longest-running women's professional sports associations in the world. Founded in 1950, the organization has grown from its roots as a playing tour into a nonprofit organization involved in every facet of golf. The LPGA Tour and the LPGA Professionals comprise the backbone of what has become the premier women's professional sports organization in the world today. The LPGA maintains a strong focus on charity through its tournaments, its grassroots junior and women's programs, and its LPGA Foundation. The LPGA is under the guidance of Commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan and is headquartered in Daytona Beach, Fla.</p>
