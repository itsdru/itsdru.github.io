            <h1>Prominent Tours and Associations</h1>
            <p>Beginning with the oldest golf tour in the world, the Professional Golfers' Association has established itself as one of the best associations for men professional golf. As a brnach off started just over 20 years after, the Ladies Profession Golf Association founded regulated and tracked matches for women. Originally the LPGA started underneath the PGA before becoming independent from the PGA of America in 1968. The European version of the PGA Tour is the DP World Tour, previously the European Tour and legally the PGA European Tour. It, like the PGA, is a men's only professional tour but solely based in Europe. Only recently did a new professional tour start up to challenge the PGA Tour; founded in Ocotober of 2021, LIV Golf provides a team and independent style tournament with higher payouts to its ranking members. As of 2023, the PGA Tour, LIV GOlf, and DP World Tour merged together.</p>

            <h3>Golf History (everyone's favorite subject!)</h3>
            <p>Golf originated from a game played on the eastern coast of Scotland, in an area close to the royal capital of Edinburgh. In those early days players would attempt to hit a pebble over sand dunes and around tracks using a bent stick or club. During the 15th century, Scotland prepared to defend itself, yet again, against an invasion by the ‘Auld Enemy’. The nation’s enthusiastic pursuit of golf however, led many to neglect their military training, so much so that the Scottish parliament of King James II banned the sport in 1457. Although people largely ignored the ban, it was only in 1502 that the game gained the royal seal of approval when King James IV of Scotland (1473 -1513) became the world’s first golfing monarch.</p>
