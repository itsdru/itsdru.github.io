            <h1>Taylor Swift</h1>
            <p>Taylor Swift is most commonly known for releasing songs based entirely on her exes, but very few have had good things said about them in these songs. Despite stating she want people to be able to dance to her music, she continously writes fairly sad songs with a solid upbeat track behind them. Over the years she has built quite the collection of exes. Ranging from Harry Styles to John Mayer, Taylor Swift has always had something to say about them.</p>
