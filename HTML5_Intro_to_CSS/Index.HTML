        <h3>Taylor Swift before 2019</h3>
        <p>October 24, 2006, Taylor Swift's debut album, <i>Taylor Swift</i>, was released by Big Machine Records in both Canada and the United States. Under Big Machine Records, Taylor Swift recorded six studio albums before leaving them in 2019 after a change of owners. Scooter Braun was supplied the money to purchase and own all the rights to Taylor Swift's records causing one of the biggest controversy's Swift has ever been in. Despite her efforts to purchase the masters to her first six studio albums, she claimed that Big Machine had not offered her favorable conditions during the negotiations. As of November 2020, Taylor's contract with Big Machine Records allowed her to go back in and rerecord her albums. The albums owned by her are marked with "(Taylor's Version)". </p>
